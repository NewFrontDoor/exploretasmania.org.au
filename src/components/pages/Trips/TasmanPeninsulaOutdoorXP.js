                        You have probably heard of the Tasman Peninsula as the location of the famous Port Arthur Historic Site. You may not know that the Tasman Peninsula is also home to a wide variety of natural wonders! On this trip we will explore some of the diverse coastal scenery on the Tasman Peninsula. This will include the towering sea cliffs of Cape Hauy, the intricate detail of the Tessellated Pavement and the power of the ocean on display at The Blowhole.

                        We would like to invite you to come with us and experience this beautiful place. While we are out in this spectacular part of the wilderness we will build friendships and we will consider faith – the Christian faith. On this trip we will open the Bible together to see what it says about God, about us and about the world.
