                        Lake St Clair is Australia’s deepest lake. It is nestled between multiple mountain ranges and surrounded by rainforest. From the cascading creeks and multicoloured mushrooms in the forest to the expansive waters of the lake and the towering surrounding mountains, there is no shortage of wonders to admire. On this 2 day trip we plan to walk through the forest, camp on the side of the lake and climb one of the surrounding mountains!

                        We would like to invite you to come with us and explore this beautiful place. While we are out in this spectacular part of the wilderness we will build friendships and we will consider faith – the Christian faith. In the evening we will open the Bible together to see what it says about God, about us and about the world.
