                        Freycinet is described by guide books as having some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. The sand is white, the ocean is pristine blue, the sea cliffs and spectacular and the surrounding mountains just add to the wonder. On this 3 day trip we plan to rock climb and abseil on the sea cliffs, walk up one of the mountains and visit two of the world-renowned beaches.

                        <br />
                        We would like to invite you to come with us and explore this beautiful place. While we are out in this spectacular part of the wilderness we will build friendships and we will consider faith – the Christian faith. Every evening on this trip we will open the Bible together to see what it says about God, about us and about the world.
