                        Lake Rhona is a beautiful lake nestled in the heart of South-West Tasmania. It has a spectacular white sand beach and is overlooked by Reeds Peak, a rugged crag on the Dennison Range. This unique part of Tasmania’s wilderness is a place that you will never forget.

                        <br />
                        We would like to invite you to come with us and explore this beautiful place. While we are out in this spectacular part of nature we will consider faith – we will think together about the God of the Bible and the Christian faith. Every evening on this trip we will open the Bible together to see what it says about God, about us and about the world. We believe that this special place – along with the whole world - was created by the God of the Bible.
